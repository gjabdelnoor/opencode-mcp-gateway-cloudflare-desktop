# OpenCode MCP Gateway Cloudflare Desktop

> [!WARNING]
> This project exposes remote shell execution, PTY control, session steering, and agent-driven code execution on the machine where it runs.
> Treat it like a personal-use remote code execution service.
> If this gateway is compromised, an attacker may be able to read files, execute commands, access credentials, damage data, or pivot deeper into your environment.
> Do not expose it to untrusted users. Use strong secrets. Keep the origin machine locked down.

This repository is the Cloudflare desktop deployment variant of `opencode-mcp-gateway`.

It is designed for:

- an Ubuntu desktop or laptop
- a local OpenCode server
- a public HTTPS MCP endpoint fronted by Cloudflare Tunnel
- Claude and ChatGPT OAuth-compatible remote MCP usage
- no VPS

Repository:

- `https://github.com/gjabdelnoor/opencode-mcp-gateway-cloudflare-desktop`

## Tested Status

This repo has been exercised against a real desktop-origin deployment behind Cloudflare Tunnel.

Validated:

- public OAuth discovery for Claude and ChatGPT
- Claude remote MCP OAuth handshake
- ChatGPT OAuth handshake
- protected resource metadata discovery
- unauthorized MCP `WWW-Authenticate` discovery flow
- session tools
- PTY tools
- direct bash tools
- multi-gateway deployment (`mcp1` through `mcp6`)
- concurrent agent usage across multiple public gateways

Latest smoke test status: `20/20` tool paths working on the live passthrough deployment.

## What We Now Know

This is the distilled set of things that the older or upstream version did not reflect clearly enough.

### 1. Cloudflare Tunnel is a real desktop deployment path

You do not need a VPS.

If your desktop is on, and both OpenCode and the gateway are running locally, Cloudflare Tunnel can expose the MCP server publicly over HTTPS.

### 2. Claude compatibility depends on real OAuth/MCP details

For Claude to work reliably, the gateway needs:

- `WWW-Authenticate` with `resource_metadata` on `/mcp` `401` responses
- protected resource metadata that advertises the actual MCP resource URL
- correct `redirect_uri` and `resource` validation during auth-code exchange

Without those, Claude may reach the login screen but still fail the connector handshake.

### 3. OpenCode PTY I/O is websocket-backed

`bash_write` and `bash_read` cannot be implemented correctly against the old REST assumptions.

OpenCode PTY interaction uses websocket transport, and this repo now uses that transport directly.

### 4. Empty assistant responses were often backend/model issues, not MCP transport failures

The original “stalled” session behavior was frequently OpenCode retrying an unsupported model.

This repo now surfaces backend retry state more clearly and supports default planning/building model overrides.

### 5. Session roots were not being set correctly by the original request shape

OpenCode expects the session `directory` on the `/session` request as a query parameter, not in the JSON body.

This repo now uses the right request shape and supports `DEFAULT_WORKSPACE_DIR`.

### 6. Multiple public gateways need unique OAuth client IDs

If all gateways advertise the same client ID, connector credential caching can collide across endpoints.

This repo uses unique client IDs per public gateway when you run multiple instances.

### 7. Model switching should not blindly trust arbitrary user input

This repo now validates `switch_model` against the live OpenCode provider/model catalog.

It also explicitly blocks two known-bad variants that were manually confirmed not to work reliably here:

- `minimax-coding-plan/MiniMax-M2.5-highspeed`
- `minimax-coding-plan/MiniMax-M2.7-highspeed`

### 8. Agents need a better way to find relevant sessions

This repo now includes a recent-session discovery tool with a one-week cutoff:

- `list_recent_sessions(limit=10, days=7)`

## Read This First

You need OpenCode installed and working before this gateway can do anything useful.

OpenCode docs:

- Intro: `https://opencode.ai/docs/`
- Providers: `https://opencode.ai/docs/providers/`
- Server mode: `https://opencode.ai/docs/server/`

Detailed docs in this repo:

- `docs/ubuntu-cloudflare-desktop-setup.md`
- `docs/session-change-map.md`

## Installation Paths

There are two practical install paths documented here.

### Path A: Purchased Domain + Cloudflare DNS

This is the recommended path.

Use this when you want a stable hostname like:

- `https://mcp.example.com/mcp`

Why this is better:

- stable OAuth issuer URL
- stable connector configuration
- better long-term reliability
- easier to run multiple gateways like `mcp1`, `mcp2`, `mcp3`

### Path B: Free Cloudflare `trycloudflare` Tunnel

This is the free, no-personal-domain path.

Use this when you want to experiment without buying or wiring a domain.

Why this is worse:

- hostname is temporary
- hostname can change on reconnect
- OAuth clients may break when the issuer URL changes
- not ideal for durable Claude or ChatGPT connectors

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Ubuntu packages

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y curl git python3 python3-pip python3-venv
```

### 2. Install and configure OpenCode

```bash
curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash
```

Then configure a provider and start OpenCode locally:

```bash
opencode serve --hostname 127.0.0.1 --port 9999
```

### 3. Clone this repo and install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gjabdelnoor/opencode-mcp-gateway-cloudflare-desktop.git
cd opencode-mcp-gateway-cloudflare-desktop
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Create `.env`

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Example:

```bash
MCP_AUTH_TOKEN=replace-with-a-long-random-secret
MCP_CLIENT_ID=opencode-mcp-gateway
MCP_ALLOWED_CLIENT_IDS=opencode-mcp-gateway
PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://mcp.example.com
DEFAULT_WORKSPACE_DIR="/home/YOUR_USER/AI Projects"
OPENCODE_HOST=127.0.0.1
OPENCODE_PORT=9999
GATEWAY_PORT=3001
ENABLE_RAW_BASH=true
DEFAULT_PLANNING_MODEL=opencode/minimax-m2.5-free
DEFAULT_BUILDING_MODEL=openai/gpt-5.4-mini
```

### 5. Choose a tunnel path

#### Purchased domain path

Install `cloudflared`:

```bash
curl -L --output cloudflared.deb https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-linux-amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i cloudflared.deb
rm cloudflared.deb
```

Authenticate and create the tunnel:

```bash
cloudflared tunnel login
cloudflared tunnel create opencode-mcp-gateway
cloudflared tunnel route dns opencode-mcp-gateway mcp.example.com
```

Create `~/.cloudflared/config.yml`:

```yaml
tunnel: YOUR_TUNNEL_ID
credentials-file: /home/YOUR_USER/.cloudflared/YOUR_TUNNEL_ID.json

ingress:
  - hostname: mcp.example.com
    service: http://127.0.0.1:3001
    originRequest:
      httpHostHeader: mcp.example.com
  - service: http_status:404
```

Set:

- `PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://mcp.example.com`

Run the tunnel:

```bash
cloudflared tunnel run opencode-mcp-gateway
```

#### Free `trycloudflare` path

Install `cloudflared` the same way, then run:

```bash
cloudflared tunnel --url http://127.0.0.1:3001
```

That gives you a temporary `https://...trycloudflare.com` URL.

Use that URL as:

- `PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://YOUR-TEMP-HOST.trycloudflare.com`

Important caveat:

- this path is still considered experimental here
- if the hostname changes, you will usually need to recreate the connector in Claude or ChatGPT

### 6. Start the gateway

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python main.py
```

## Verify The Deployment

Check:

```bash
curl https://mcp.example.com/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server
curl https://mcp.example.com/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server/mcp
curl https://mcp.example.com/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource
curl -D - -o /dev/null https://mcp.example.com/mcp
```

You want:

- OAuth issuer: `https://mcp.example.com`
- token endpoint: `https://mcp.example.com/oauth/token`
- protected resource: `https://mcp.example.com/mcp`
- unauthorized `/mcp` returns `401` with `WWW-Authenticate` and `resource_metadata`

## Connect ChatGPT Or Claude

MCP server URL:

```text
https://mcp.example.com/mcp
```

OAuth discovery URLs:

- Claude: `https://mcp.example.com/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`
- ChatGPT: `https://mcp.example.com/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server/mcp`

Manual OAuth values when needed:

- OAuth Client ID: `opencode-mcp-gateway`
- OAuth Client Secret: your `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN`
- Token auth method: `client_secret_post`
- Scope: `mcp`

## Multiple Concurrent Agents

If you want multiple chatbot-controlled agents at once, run multiple gateway processes.

Recommended layout:

- `mcp1.example.com -> localhost:3001`
- `mcp2.example.com -> localhost:3002`
- `mcp3.example.com -> localhost:3003`
- `mcp4.example.com -> localhost:3004`
- `mcp5.example.com -> localhost:3005`
- `mcp6.example.com -> localhost:3006`

Each instance should have its own:

- `PUBLIC_BASE_URL`
- `GATEWAY_PORT`
- `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN`
- `MCP_CLIENT_ID`

## Configuration

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` | Bearer secret for OAuth token exchange and MCP access |
| `MCP_CLIENT_ID` | Main OAuth client ID accepted by the gateway |
| `MCP_ALLOWED_CLIENT_IDS` | Optional comma-separated allowlist of additional client IDs |
| `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` | External HTTPS base URL advertised in OAuth metadata |
| `DEFAULT_WORKSPACE_DIR` | Default project root for new sessions and PTYs |
| `OPENCODE_HOST` | OpenCode origin host |
| `OPENCODE_PORT` | OpenCode origin port |
| `GATEWAY_PORT` | Gateway listen port |
| `ENABLE_RAW_BASH` | Enables direct `bash` and `bash_exec` tools |
| `DEFAULT_PLANNING_MODEL` | Optional fallback model for planning-mode sessions |
| `DEFAULT_BUILDING_MODEL` | Optional fallback model for building-mode sessions |
| `BLOCKED_SESSION_MODELS` | Optional comma-separated models to reject even if OpenCode advertises them |

## Troubleshooting

### ChatGPT says the server URL is invalid

Use the full MCP URL:

```text
https://mcp.example.com/mcp
```

### Claude reaches login but the connector still fails

Check:

- `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` is correct
- protected resource metadata returns `https://mcp.example.com/mcp`
- `GET /mcp` without auth returns `401` with `WWW-Authenticate`
- the OAuth client secret exactly matches `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN`

### `session_create` or `send_message` looks stalled

Check:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:9999/session/status
```

If OpenCode is retrying an unsupported model, set or adjust:

```bash
DEFAULT_PLANNING_MODEL=opencode/minimax-m2.5-free
DEFAULT_BUILDING_MODEL=openai/gpt-5.4-mini
```

### `switch_model` rejects a model you thought should work

The gateway now validates against OpenCode’s live model catalog.

It will reject:

- anything not currently exposed by OpenCode
- the two known-bad blocked models:
  - `minimax-coding-plan/MiniMax-M2.5-highspeed`
  - `minimax-coding-plan/MiniMax-M2.7-highspeed`

### Sessions are starting in the wrong folder

Set:

```bash
DEFAULT_WORKSPACE_DIR="/home/YOUR_USER/AI Projects"
```

This repo now defaults new sessions and PTYs to that workspace if you do not pass an explicit directory.

### Several bots interfere with each other

Use separate gateway instances on separate hostnames and ports.
